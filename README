That project is part of the showcase platform for C++ projects.

It is named 'meta', as it wraps the other components in order to integrate
them. The 'meta' project is very thin, and does contain any code nor test.
It is made of a (Ruby) Rake file, and its accompanying YAML-formatted
parameter file.
